When you're just getting started with Kombo, you might not want to invest the
time into building a proper integration with [Kombo Connect](/connect) yet.
Because of that, we allow you to send what we call "Magic links" to your
customers that allow them to go through the connection flow without you having
to change anything about your application.

## Setting up an integration

To get started, open up [the dashboard](https://app.kombo.dev) and click on "New
integration":

Then, select "Let your customer create the integration":

In the next step, select the integration category (e.g., HRIS) and which
customer it's for:

After clicking "Continue," you'll get a link that you can share with your
customer:

Clicking on this link will take your customer to a special version of the Kombo
Connect flow hosted by us:

After they've gone through the flow, the integration will be set up and you'll
get a notification via email. You can then start using our unified API. To learn
more about that, check out
[our general Getting Started guide](/getting-started).
