When you're just getting started with Kombo, you might not want to invest the
time into building a proper integration with [Kombo Connect](/connect) yet.
Because of that, we allow you to _manually_ set up integrations through the
Kombo Dashboard.

## Setting up an integration

To get started, open up [the dashboard](https://app.kombo.dev) and click on "New
integration":

Then, select "Create the integration yourself":

In the next step, select the integration category (e.g., HRIS) and which
customer it's for:

After clicking "Continue," you'll then be presented with the regular
[Kombo Connect](/connect) flow, except that in this case, it's _you_ going
through it and not your customer:

After going through the flow, the integration will be set up, and you can start
using our unified API. To learn more about that, check out
[our general Getting Started guide](/getting-started).
