## The problem

If you've ever built an integration with a more legacy or enterprise system,
you'll know the struggles you have to go through to perform even the simplest of
reads:

Information about a single concept (e.g., an employee) is spread across five
different endpoints, requests sometimes take minutes to finish, and unreliable
servers force you to implement complex retry logic.

**We were faced with a choice:** Either we expose these same problems to our
customers, resulting in slow and unreliable endpoints, or we come up with a
solution â€” we decided to go with the latter.

## The solution

We're now mirroring the data in the source systems into a database at regular
intervals (and when you [manually trigger a sync](/reference/trigger-sync)).
When you call our API, we will simply read from this database, resulting in
endpoints that always respond reliably and quickly.

Through our syncing approach, we can also provide [webhooks](/webhooks) for
systems that don't provide webhooks themselves.

<Note>
  Note that syncs adhere to [your scope config](/scopes), so if there are
  sensitive data points you're not using, then those will **not** end up in our
  database.
