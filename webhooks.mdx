## Webhook Use Case

Use our webhooks to be notified about finished syncs. This allows you to fetch
any changes that occurred during a sync. This allows you to keep your database
up to date without scheduling/polling.  
Easily test webhooks with [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).

## Enable Webhooks

You can configure your Kombo webhooks in the dashboard directly in
the[ webhooks tab](https://app.kombo.dev/env/webhooks). After creating the first
webhook, a random webhook secret will be generated and shown. Learn in _validate
the data_ how to use it.

## Data Schema

Our webhooks follow this schema:

```json JSON
{
  "id": "5gjAtURLPbnTiwgkaBfiA3WJ",
  "type": "sync-finished",
  "data": {
    "sync_id": "EY2KfFEZ5Vc2FVfVUQFpRduM",
    "sync_state": "SUCCEEDED",
    "sync_started_at": "2022-11-02T10:50:10.242Z",
    "sync_ended_at": "2022-11-02T10:50:14.751Z",
    "sync_duration_seconds": 14.509,
    "integration_id": "personio:hris-dev",
    "integration_tool": "personio",
    "integration_category": "HRIS"
  }
}
```

## Validate the data

Anyone could post data to your webhook URL. That's why we're signing each
request with a secret specific to your Kombo account. The secret is called
`Kombo Webhook Secret` and will be sent to you when we activate Webhooks for
you.

Each valid webhook POST from us will include the `X-Kombo-Signature` header.
Validate it by using HMAC-SHA256 to sign the request body with the
`Kombo Webhook Secret` and then digest it with `base64url`.

In Node.js, it could, for example, look like this:

```ts TypeScript
import { createHmac } from "node:crypto";

const signatureHeader = req.headers["x-kombo-signature"];

// Get the raw UTF-8-encoded string body because this was used for signing
const body = request.body;

const signature = createHmac("sha256", signatureSecret)
  .update(body, "utf8")
  .digest("base64url");

const isValidRequest = signature === signatureHeader;
```
