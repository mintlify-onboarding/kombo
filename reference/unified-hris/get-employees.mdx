_Not interested in most fields? You can use our [our Scopes feature](https://docs.kombo.dev/docs/scopes) to customize what data points will synced._

<Note>
  If the first sync did not finish yet, a `503` status code will be returned to
  ensure you don't get incomplete data. This allows you to pull until the data
  is complete (we recommend you to depend on our webhooks though).
</Note>
