openapi: "POST /force-sync"
description: "Trigger a sync for a specific integration."

<Note>
  Please note that it is **not** necessary nor recommended to call this endpoint
  periodically on your side. Kombo already performs period syncs for you and you
  should only trigger syncs yourself in special cases (like when a user clicks
  on a "Sync" button in your app).
