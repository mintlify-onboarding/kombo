<Warning>
  This guide assumes you already have a Kombo account. If that's not the case,
  visit [our website](https://www.kombo.dev/) to learn more and get access.
</Warning>

## Adding your first integration

1. Log in to the [Kombo Dashboard](https://app.kombo.dev)
2. Go to the "Integrations" page
3. Click "New integration":

4. Select "Create the integration yourself":

5. Work your way through the flow and enter the necessary credentials

### Your first integration ID

After going through the connection flow, your newly created integration will
appear on your dashboard. It will probably look something like this:

![1422](/images/d5998af-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_16.14.12.png "Screen Shot 2022-10-07 at 16.14.12.png")![1422](/images/d5998af-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_16.14.12.png "Click to close...")

Note the bold string at the top starting with the name of the tool you've
connected (`factorial` in this example): that's the **integration ID**. It
uniquely identifies this integration, and you'll include it in all related API
requests.

## Using the unified API

Now that you've created an integration, it's time to get to the most crucial
part: Actually calling the Kombo API to retrieve data from the integration.

Thanks to our interactive API documentation, you'll be able to do this right
from your browser. To get started, head over to our [API reference](/reference)
and choose an endpoint from the category of your integration (e.g., HRIS or
ATS).

### Calling the endpoint

Let's say we want to retrieve all the employees in Factorial (the HRIS system I
connected for this example). To do this, I'll have to call
[the /hris/employees endpoint](/reference/get%5Fhris-employees).

![1346](/images/4fb50a4-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_16.51.23.png "Screen Shot 2022-10-07 at 16.51.23.png")![1346](/images/4fb50a4-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_16.51.23.png "Click to close...")

_The endpoint I'll be using in this example._

### Configuring the headers

Before we can send off the request, there are two things we have to configure:

#### API key

First, we have to set our **Kombo API key**, which ensures that _only you_ can
request data from your customers' integrations. Enter it in the "Authentication"
field in the top right:

![948](/images/23f73e6-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_17.03.27.png "Screen Shot 2022-10-07 at 17.03.27.png")![948](/images/23f73e6-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_17.03.27.png "Click to close...")

#### Integration ID

You've likely got a single integration set up at this point, but you'll probably
have many in the future. That's why you have to specify which integration you're
requesting data for with each request. This can be done through the
`X-Integration-Id` header, which you can find at the bottom of the page:

![1282](/images/4701a78-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_17.11.19.png "Screen Shot 2022-10-07 at 17.11.19.png")![1282](/images/4701a78-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_17.11.19.png "Click to close...")

As you can see, I've already entered the integration of the Factorial
integration I've created above. Now everything is ready to send the request:
Scroll back up and **_Try it!_**

![920](/images/cd2ab94-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_17.18.43.png "Screen Shot 2022-10-07 at 17.18.43.png")![920](/images/cd2ab94-Screen_Shot_2022-10-07_at_17.18.43.png "Click to close...")

You should now see a list of employees (or whatever the endpoint you chose
returns), congratulations!

### Programmatically calling the API

Calling the Kombo API through the documentation site works great for
experimenting, but you'll likely want to integrate Kombo into your own
application. In the future, we'll be providing official SDKs for this purpose,
but for now, you can use our docs to generate code snippets.

To do this, select your programming language in the top right. You'll then be
provided with the code you need to make the same API call you made
interactively:

## Wrapping up

In this guide, we've:

- created a new integration through the Kombo dashboard
- learned about integration IDs and Kombo's authentication
- made a request to the Kombo API through the interactive docs
- generated code to interact with the Kombo API programmatically

You're now ready to continue on your own. Go build great things! âœ¨
